	abstract = {Industry competition shocks are major drivers of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). We document strong positive effects of competition shocks on M&A-related covenant redesign. Acquiring firms in high-competition environments are significantly more likely to undertake tender offer bond repurchases and reduce restrictions on mergers, investments, payouts, and financing, but increase change-in-control covenants. This effect is stronger for larger, more profitable firms. Moreover, announcement returns from M&A transactions of redesigning firms in more competitive settings are significantly higher, while acquisition deal premiums are lower. Our study shows the significant effect of industry competition shocks on debt recontracting in M&A. (JEL G32, G34)},

	abstract = {The demand for flood insurance is low when the frequency and severity of flood disasters are increasing due to climate change. We show that beliefs about climate change influence homeowners' choice and level of flood insurance coverage. The demand for voluntary flood insurance coverage for homes and contents is higher in areas with more people who are worried about global warming. Property-level analysis shows that individuals are more likely to terminate flood insurance after unanticipated premium increases if they do not perceive climate change as a risk. We use the heterogeneous impact of widening partisan polarization on climate change beliefs to rule out alternative explanations.},

@article{Gatchev2022,
	abstract = {We propose a new measure of the exploratory activities of companies based on the idea that experimentation with new courses of action and the need to describe them entails the adoption of new words in firm regulatory disclosures. Unlike traditional indicators, such as R&D spending, the proposed exploration indicator is available for all publicly traded firms across all industries. The exploration indicator predicts firm knowledge accumulation, as measured by future patenting and trademarking activities. It further shows that firm exploration declines after periods of high R&D spending and over time. The exploration indicator correlates positively with firm risk and exhibits a distinct positive impact on firm value unexplained by traditional innovation indicators. Our language-based approach can be applied to measure creative contributions in other domains, such as government grant applications and academic publications.},

@article{Anagol2017,
	abstract = {Commissions-motivated agents have historically helped the development of many markets, but research suggests brokers motivated by commissions sometimes steer consumers towards inappropriate products. This issue is particularly important in household financial markets where consumers may be unable to evaluate products on their own. While reforms attempting to limit commission payments have been undertaken worldwide, little research has evaluated the impact of these reforms. We study a major Indian investor protection reform that attempted to reduce commissions tied to mutual fund sales by banning the distribution fees that mutual funds had previously earmarked for commissions. We analyze the policy impact by comparing funds charging high versus low distribution fees pre-reform and find no evidence that the reform itself reduced fund flows. We argue that the most plausible explanation is that the Indian asset management industry maintained substantial commissions to brokers through other revenue sources apart from the banned distribution fees.},

Individual angels with demonstrated seed-stage success experience an increase in the quantity, quality, and geographic and industry spread of their coinvestment connections relative to unsuccessful peers and are rewarded with more deal flow. These results are stronger for less-established angels and for angels whose successes are more indicative of their ability. Success also begets more success: the portfolio companies of successful angels are more likely to receive follow-on financing, especially from VC firms. Our results highlight how angels grow their coinvestment networks. (JEL G24, L14, L26, M13).},
