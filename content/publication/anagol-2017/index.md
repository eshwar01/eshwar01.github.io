abstract: Commissions-motivated agents have historically helped the development of
  many markets, but research suggests brokers motivated by commissions sometimes steer
  consumers towards inappropriate products. This issue is particularly important in
  household financial markets where consumers may be unable to evaluate products on
  their own. While reforms attempting to limit commission payments have been undertaken
  worldwide, little research has evaluated the impact of these reforms. We study a
  major Indian investor protection reform that attempted to reduce commissions tied
  to mutual fund sales by banning the distribution fees that mutual funds had previously
  earmarked for commissions. We analyze the policy impact by comparing funds charging
  high versus low distribution fees pre-reform and find no evidence that the reform
  itself reduced fund flows. We argue that the most plausible explanation is that
  the Indian asset management industry maintained substantial commissions to brokers
  through other revenue sources apart from the banned distribution fees.
