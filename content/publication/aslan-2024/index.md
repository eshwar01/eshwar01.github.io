abstract: Industry competition shocks are major drivers of mergers and acquisitions
  (M&A). We document strong positive effects of competition shocks on M&A-related
  covenant redesign. Acquiring firms in high-competition environments are significantly
  more likely to undertake tender offer bond repurchases and reduce restrictions on
  mergers, investments, payouts, and financing, but increase change-in-control covenants.
  This effect is stronger for larger, more profitable firms. Moreover, announcement
  returns from M&A transactions of redesigning firms in more competitive settings
  are significantly higher, while acquisition deal premiums are lower. Our study shows
  the significant effect of industry competition shocks on debt recontracting in M&A.
