abstract: We propose a new measure of the exploratory activities of companies based
  on the idea that experimentation with new courses of action and the need to describe
  them entails the adoption of new words in firm regulatory disclosures. Unlike traditional
  indicators, such as R&D spending, the proposed exploration indicator is available
  for all publicly traded firms across all industries. The exploration indicator predicts
  firm knowledge accumulation, as measured by future patenting and trademarking activities.
  It further shows that firm exploration declines after periods of high R&D spending
  and over time. The exploration indicator correlates positively with firm risk and
  exhibits a distinct positive impact on firm value unexplained by traditional innovation
  indicators. Our language-based approach can be applied to measure creative contributions
  in other domains, such as government grant applications and academic publications.
