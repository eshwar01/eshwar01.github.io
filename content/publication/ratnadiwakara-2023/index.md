abstract: The demand for flood insurance is low when the frequency and severity of
  flood disasters are increasing due to climate change. We show that beliefs about
  climate change influence homeowners' choice and level of flood insurance coverage.
  The demand for voluntary flood insurance coverage for homes and contents is higher
  in areas with more people who are worried about global warming. Property-level analysis
  shows that individuals are more likely to terminate flood insurance after unanticipated
  premium increases if they do not perceive climate change as a risk. We use the heterogeneous
  impact of widening partisan polarization on climate change beliefs to rule out alternative
  explanations.
