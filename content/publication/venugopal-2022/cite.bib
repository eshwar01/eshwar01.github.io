 abstract = {Using hand-collected data, we show that coinvestment is widespread in the angel investment market, even among seed-stage startups. Individual angels with demonstrated seed-stage success experience an increase in the quantity, quality, and geographic and industry spread of their coinvestment connections relative to unsuccessful peers and are rewarded with more deal flow. These results are stronger for less-established angels and for angels whose successes are more indicative of their ability. Success also begets more success: the portfolio companies of successful angels are more likely to receive follow-on financing, especially from VC firms. Our results highlight how angels grow their coinvestment networks. (JEL G24, L14, L26, M13).},
