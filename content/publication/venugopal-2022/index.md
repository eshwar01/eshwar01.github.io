abstract: 'Using hand-collected data, we show that coinvestment is widespread in the
  angel investment market, even among seed-stage startups. Individual angels with
  demonstrated seed-stage success experience an increase in the quantity, quality,
  and geographic and industry spread of their coinvestment connections relative to
  unsuccessful peers and are rewarded with more deal flow. These results are stronger
  for less-established angels and for angels whose successes are more indicative of
  their ability. Success also begets more success: the portfolio companies of successful
  angels are more likely to receive follow-on financing, especially from VC firms.
  Our results highlight how angels grow their coinvestment networks. (JEL G24, L14,
  L26, M13).'
