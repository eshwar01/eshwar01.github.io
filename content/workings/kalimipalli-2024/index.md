abstract: Labor market frictions can influence terms of contracting in the credit market and thereby impact the financing costs for borrowing firms. In this paper, we examine how labor union strength may influence private and public debt covenants. We employ fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and use plant-level union election outcome data for firms (between 1977 and 2020) as a quasi-exogenous shock to examine the effect of labor unions on firm-level loan and bond market covenants. Our extensive RDD analysis shows that unionization leads to significantly lower covenants in public bond issuances and in particular reduced levels of (a) Investment, (b) Subsequent financing, and (c) Event-related bond restrictions. Loan markets show limited evidence of covenant reduction implying that bank lending, typically collateralized,  is less sensitive to labor market frictions.  Firm-level channel analyses show that following successful union elections, stronger unions help mitigate the agency risks and reduce covenant threshold in firms with other forms of monitoring in place (i.e., firms in highly competitive product markets, firms with high institutional ownership, firms with high credit ratings, and firms with better corporate governance). Sub-sample analyses based on firm characteristics show that the negative effect of union on covenant is stronger for firms with higher levels of risk ex-ante (i.e., firms with higher R\&D investment ratio, firms with higher leverage ratio, and firms with lower profitability ratio). Our results are therefore consistent with the argument that lenders' and unions' interests are closely aligned in non-bankruptcy states, thereby leading to lowering monitoring costs for creditors and reduced dependence on tighter bond covenant restrictions.
