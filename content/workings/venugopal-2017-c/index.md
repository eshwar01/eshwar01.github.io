abstract: Using unique hand-collected data on startups that were seed-funded by individual
  angel investors, I show that social connections between angels and entrepreneurs,
  obtained via schools, past employment and ethnicity, positively influence investment
  decisions of angels, and the subsequent performance of startups. Social connections,
  irrespective of the ranking of the school or employer they were formed, are crucial
  for obtaining early-stage startup financing particularly in markets with higher
  information asymmetry. Connected seed-stage startups are more likely to survive
  longer, raise more series A funds and are more likely to attract venture capital
  investments than unconnected startups. The estimates of a two-stage selection correction
  model show that the higher performance of connected startups is because of post-investment
  influence of angel investors, via better information exchange and coordination.
